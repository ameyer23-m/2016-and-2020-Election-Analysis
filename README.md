# Summary of Project
This project looked at how the voting patterns changed from the 2016 presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump to the 2020 presidential election between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Based on the initial work, I found that from 2016 to 2020 Trump gained supporters on the Southern Boarder of Texas from Demacrats, while he gain voters in the Utah/Idaho/Nevada areas from non Repulican/Democrat voters, because Biden got a similar percentage to Clinton. Therefore the extra voters came from people that did not vote for the democrats.

# Next Steps
- Create model that determines what varibles cause an increase in voter turnout for both Democrats and Republicans between the two elections
